--HELP FILE--Flexy admin skinCreated: 16/06/2009By: KriesiThank you for purchasing my theme. --TABLE OF CONTENTS--A) HTMLB) CSS FilesC) Javascript D) PSD FilesE) Icons----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A) HTMLThe HTML is valid xhtml 1.0 strict and comes with predefined classes for common elements needed in web design.To style the different Elements on your page look at the classes used in the template and apply them accordingly.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------B) CSSThe CSS for the theme is split into two files: one that holds the basic markup for layout and one that contains the specific color information for the 7 different styles. The fist one (style_all.css) is shared among all skins, but each skin has a separate second file for the aforementioned color information. If you want to create a unique layout just change the settings in on of the stylessheets of folder "CSS"To change the color scheme open the index.html file and look into the html head, here you will find style1.css linked and the others as comments. just exchange the one linked with one of the files in the comments and you switched color scheme.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------C) JavascriptThe theme uses advanced jQuery functions. You do not need to know how to use jQuery to activate them, they all respond to specific classes and ids in your html code.The following functions are available:1.) closable elementsif you want to create a closable element just like the bottom messages in the response message tab apply the class "closeable". Javascript will add a small X to the right top of the element. If this X is clicked the element will be closed.2.) Rich text editorif you want a textarea to contain basic markup buttons like h1,h2,h3, font size changing etc just add the class "wysiwyg". (abbr for what you see is what you get)3.) DialogThe theme comes with the jquery ui dialog expansion to display messages via javascript. to do so just add the id "dialog" to an element. For further information check http://jqueryui.com/demos4.) DatepickerThe theme uses the jquery ui datepicker. to add the datepicker to an input field just add the class "flexy_datepicker_input" to an input field. if you want to display the calendar without input field add ".flexy_datepicker" to a div. For further information check http://jqueryui.com/demos5.)Internet explorer png fixIf you want to use additional transparent png files just add the class "ie6fix" to the element that has the image applied to make internet explorer render it correctly.6.) Sidebar toggle navigationThe sidebar navigation contains nested lists. Each sub list is hidden and can be opened by a click on the parent element. If you want a list to be open when opening the page add the class "opened"7) Maybe the most complicated function is getting the main tabs to work that are located above the content. To do so you have to create a repeating html structure that looks like this:	<div id="main"> <!-- dont repeat this element -->		<div id="content"> <!-- dont repeat this element -->			<div class="jquery_tab"> <!--repeat this element for each tab you want to create -->                                <div class="content_block"> <!--repeat this element for each tab you want to create -->                                	<h2 class="jquery_tab_title">Title of the Tab</h2> <!--repeat this element for each tab you want to create -->					//content//                                </div> <!--end content_block -->                        </div> <!--end jquery tab -->			<div class="jquery_tab"> <!--repeat this element for each tab you want to create -->                                <div class="content_block"> <!--repeat this element for each tab you want to create -->                                	<h2 class="jquery_tab_title">Title of the Tab</h2> <!--repeat this element for each tab you want to create -->					//content//                                </div> <!--end content_block -->                        </div> <!--end jquery tab -->			</div><!--end content-->	</div><!--end main-->as you can see, foe each tab you want to use you have to wrap the content within a div with class "jquery_tab" and another div with class content_block. The title by the tab is copied from the element with the class "jquery_tab_title" (a h2 tag in our case)if you want to display a page without tabs simply dont add the div with the class "jquery_tab"----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------D) PSD FilesAmong with the theme come all psd files needed to edit the different skins. With these psds you can even create your own unique Flexy skin.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------E) IconsThe Icon set used is called danish icon set, created by Jonas Rask. I have only included some of them into the icon folder for demonstration purpose, you can download the full set for free and without limitations of use at http://jonas.seph.ws/stuff/drf.zip-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Once again, thank you so much for purchasing this theme ;)Cheers Kriesi
